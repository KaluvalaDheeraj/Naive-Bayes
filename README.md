# Naive-Bayes
A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model thatâ€™s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.
p(A/B)=(p(B/A) * p(A))/p(B)
Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive.
